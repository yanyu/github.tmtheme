# GitHub.tmTheme

This is my take on a GitHub theme for TextMate.

This theme was created from scratch by copying colours from the GitHub pygments stylesheet. This way should highlight the differences between TextMate’s and pygments’ parser, but still have a “GitHubby” feel to it.

You should also check out [Scott Becker’s take](http://github.com/sbecker/github_textmate_theme/tree/master), as he used actual highlighted examples to create it and thus probably mirrors the GitHub highlighting more closely.


## Installation

Just double-click or `open` the GitHub.tmTheme file and TextMate will take care of installing it for you.

### Install Pacu Theme ###

1. Download GitHub.js
2. Copy it to: /Applications/Pacu.app/Contents/charcoal/themes/
3. Restart Pacu and select the GitHub theme from the preferences dialog.
